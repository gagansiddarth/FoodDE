# User Data Persistence Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds persistent user profile data and scan history storage mapped to user email addresses, ensuring users can access their data from any device.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `MANUAL_DB_UPDATE.sql`
- **Purpose**: Adds additional profile fields to the `profiles` table
- **New Fields**:
  - `full_name` (TEXT)
  - `age` (INTEGER)
  - `gender` (TEXT with constraints)
  - `location` (TEXT)
  - `email` (TEXT)

### 2. Profile Management Utility
- **File**: `src/shared/utils/profile.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralized functions for profile CRUD operations
- **Functions**:
  - `getUserProfile()` - Fetch user profile by ID
  - `upsertUserProfile()` - Create or update profile
  - `updateUserProfile()` - Update existing profile
  - `getCurrentUserProfile()` - Get current user's profile

### 3. Authentication Flow Updates
- **File**: `src/features/auth/Auth.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Automatically creates user profile on sign-in
  - Stores user email in profile
  - Handles profile creation for new users

### 4. Profile Component Updates
- **File**: `src/features/profile/Profile.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Loads profile data from database instead of localStorage
  - Saves profile changes to database
  - Creates profile if it doesn't exist
  - Maintains backward compatibility

### 5. Type Definitions
- **File**: `src/shared/utils/supabase/types.ts`
- **Changes**: Updated to include new profile fields

## Scan Storage
Scan history was already properly implemented and stored in the database:
- Scans are automatically saved to `scans` table when users analyze ingredients
- Each scan is linked to the user's ID (which is mapped to their email)
- Users can access their scan history from any device
- Saved scans are marked with `saved=true` flag

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the database migration manually:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `MANUAL_DB_UPDATE.sql`

```sql
-- Add additional profile fields for user information
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS full_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS age INTEGER CHECK (age > 0 AND age < 150),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gender TEXT CHECK (gender IN ('male', 'female', 'other', 'prefer-not-to-say')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS location TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email TEXT;
```

## How It Works

### User Registration/Login
1. User signs up or logs in with email/password
2. System automatically creates a profile record in the database
3. User's email is stored in the profile for mapping

### Profile Management
1. When user visits profile page, data is loaded from database
2. If no profile exists, one is created automatically
3. Profile changes are saved to database in real-time
4. Data persists across devices and sessions

### Scan History
1. Every ingredient analysis is automatically saved to database
2. Scans are linked to user ID (which maps to email)
3. Users can access their scan history from any device
4. Saved scans are marked and displayed in the "Saved" section

## Benefits
- ✅ User profile data persists across devices
- ✅ Scan history is accessible from any device
- ✅ No more asking for profile details on every login
- ✅ Data is securely stored in Supabase database
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Automatic profile creation for new users

## Testing
After running the database migration:
1. Create a new user account
2. Fill in profile details
3. Perform some ingredient scans
4. Log out and log back in from a different device
5. Verify profile data and scan history are preserved
