# Saved Scans Functionality

## ✅ **Complete Implementation**

The saved scans functionality is fully implemented and working! Users can save, view, and manage their ingredient analysis scans across all devices.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Scan Creation**
- Every time a user analyzes ingredients (via image upload, camera, or text input), a scan is automatically created in the database
- Scans are initially saved with `saved: false` (unsaved)
- Each scan is linked to the user's ID for proper data isolation

### 2. **Save Functionality**
- Users can click the "Save Scan" button on the results page
- This marks the scan as `saved: true` in the database
- Saved scans are accessible from the `/saved` page

### 3. **Saved Scans Page** (`/saved`)
- Displays all scans where `saved: true` for the current user
- Shows scan details including:
  - Date and time of analysis
  - Raw ingredient text
  - Health score with color-coded badges
  - Health flags and warnings
  - Quick health advice
- Actions available:
  - **View Details**: Navigate to full results page
  - **Ask AI**: Start a chat about the scan
  - **Unsave**: Remove from saved list (sets `saved: false`)
  - **Delete**: Permanently delete the scan

### 4. **Cross-Device Access**
- All scans are stored in the Supabase database
- Users can access their saved scans from any device by logging in
- Data persists across sessions and devices

## Database Schema

### Scans Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.scans (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  source TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (source IN ('image','text')),
  image_url TEXT,
  raw_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  cleaned_ingredients TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  analysis JSONB NOT NULL,
  saved BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Key Features
- **User Isolation**: Each scan is linked to a user ID via foreign key
- **Row Level Security**: Users can only access their own scans
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Created and updated timestamps
- **Flexible Storage**: Analysis results stored as JSONB
- **Source Tracking**: Tracks whether scan came from image or text

## API Functions

### Core Functions (in `src/shared/utils/db.ts`)

1. **`createScan()`**: Creates a new scan (initially unsaved)
2. **`markScanSaved()`**: Marks an existing scan as saved
3. **`saveScanToSupabase()`**: Creates a scan that's immediately saved
4. **`fetchLatestScan()`**: Gets the most recent scan for a user

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Create a scan (automatically happens after analysis)
const { id, error } = await createScan({
  source: 'image',
  raw_text: 'Ingredients text...',
  cleaned_ingredients: ['ingredient1', 'ingredient2'],
  analysis: analysisResult,
  saved: false
});

// Mark scan as saved (when user clicks Save button)
const { error } = await markScanSaved(scanId);

// Get all saved scans for current user
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('scans')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .eq('saved', true)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User analyzes ingredients** → Scan created in database (`saved: false`)
2. **User clicks "Save Scan"** → Scan marked as `saved: true`
3. **User visits `/saved` page** → All saved scans displayed
4. **User can manage scans** → Unsave or delete as needed

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: Users must be logged in to save/view scans
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own scans
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level security policies
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

## Performance Optimizations

- **Indexed Queries**: Database indexes on `user_id` and `created_at`
- **Efficient Queries**: Only fetch necessary fields
- **Lazy Loading**: Scans loaded only when needed
- **Caching**: React state management for UI responsiveness

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Authentication Errors**: Redirect to login when needed
- **Validation Errors**: User-friendly error messages
- **Database Errors**: Detailed logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Search/Filter**: Search saved scans by ingredient or date
2. **Categories**: Organize scans into categories
3. **Export**: Export scans to PDF or CSV
4. **Sharing**: Share scans with other users
5. **Analytics**: Track health trends over time
6. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple scans for batch operations

## Testing the Functionality

1. **Create a user account** and log in
2. **Analyze some ingredients** (upload image or enter text)
3. **Click "Save Scan"** on the results page
4. **Visit `/saved` page** to see your saved scans
5. **Test cross-device access** by logging in from another device
6. **Try unsaving and deleting** scans

The saved scans functionality is production-ready and provides a complete user experience for managing ingredient analysis history!
